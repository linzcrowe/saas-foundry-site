## Code Example: AI Integration

Here's a simple example of how AI might be integrated into a SaaS product:

def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

user_query = "How can I improve my product's user experience?"
ai_suggestion = generate_response(user_query)
print(ai_suggestion)
