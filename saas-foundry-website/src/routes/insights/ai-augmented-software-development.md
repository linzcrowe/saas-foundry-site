# Implementing AI-Augmented Software Development

Integrating AI into your software development process can significantly enhance efficiency, improve code quality, and accelerate delivery timelines. This article outlines a structured approach to implementing AI-augmented software development, covering key aspects from identification to implementation.

Before we dive into the process, please bare a few things in mind.
* Analysis should be short and timeboxed, a couple of hours at most.
* If nervous about adoption, try month long trials. Real day to day use is the only true test.
* Tools require training and building new habits.

## 1. Identify Where You Will Use AI

Every organisation and team is different, yet there are common elements you can focus on. Find where your team spends the most time and where they are most frustrated. This is where AI can have the most impact.

### Suggested Areas:

- **Mapping Stories to High-Level Technical Implementation Planning:** Use AI to help map user stories to technical tasks, providing a blueprint for developers. Note that it is the developer who performs this step.
- **AI-Powered Coding Assistance:** Integrate AI into IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, to help developers understand, write, and review code, and write unit tests. 
- **AI-Driven Code Reviews:** Employ AI to conduct preliminary code reviews, identifying potential improvements before human peer review.

## 2. Identify Tools and Platforms

Once you know your areas, you should follow this process.

1. **Define Requirements:** Clearly outline what you need from an AI tool. Consider factors such as language support, IDE support, integration capabilities, and specific features like code suggestion. Keep ir short and simple, a few bullet points.

2. **Research and Shortlist:** Conduct research to identify tools that meet your requirements. Look for tools with positive reviews, active user communities, and strong support from developers. This must be timeboxed to a few hours.

3. **Evaluate Capabilities:** Assess each tool’s capabilities through demos, trials, and case studies. Consider how well they integrate with your existing tools and workflows. Again, this must be timeboxed to a few hours. Beyond that only real-world use will teach you more.

4. **Consider Scalability and Security:** Ensure the tool can scale with your team and complies with your organization’s security and IP protection standards. This is generally about their commercial models such as whether they're subscription all-you-can-eat or credit based, how security is implemented such as user login vs API keys, and if they can guarantee your data won't be used to train models.

5. **Gather Feedback:** Involve key stakeholders, including developers, technical leads, and security teams, to gather feedback on shortlisted tools. Note that feedback about tools often points to a lack of awareness of how to use such tools, so look to training and education before switching tools.

### Example of this process

Lets say we're looking for an AI-powered coding assistance tool. We've identified the following requirements:
1) IDE support for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.
2) Language support for C#, Javascript and Python.
3) Easy addition of context to prompts, especially contents of files
4) No training of models on data provided, IP kept safe.

The next step is to research some tools that can meet some or all of our needs. Some candidates are:

| Feature        | GitHub Copilot | Tabnine       | Amazon CodeWhisperer | Gemini Code Assist |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| IDE Support    | Excellent      | Very Good     | Very Good             | Good       |
| Languages      | Excellent      | Excellent      | Excellent             | Excellent                               |
| Context        | Very Good     | Very Good     | Very Good             | Good      |
| Data Privacy   | Good           | Excellent (self-hosting) | Good                  | Good |

To evaluate their capabilties I would limit to 30 minute windows to:
1) Install and configure in my IDE.
2) Take a large, open source project in each language and use it to understand code, suggest how to implement enhancements, and make those changes
3) Test how up to date the model is with features or versions of the languages you use

Evaluating scalability and security can then be summed up in a table like this.
| Tool                   | Commercial Model                                  | IP Protection / Data Privacy                                                                      | Estimated Annual Cost (20 users) |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| GitHub Copilot         | Per-user subscription (monthly/yearly)            | Your code may be used for model improvements (check their terms). Not self-hostable.              | $2400 - $4800                   |
| Tabnine                 | Per-user subscription (with free tier); Enterprise options with self-hosting available | Self-hosting ensures complete data privacy. Cloud options have varying data usage policies.       | $2400 - $4800 (cloud); Varies (self-hosted) |
| Amazon CodeWhisperer   | Pay-as-you-go (Individual tier free for personal use) | Your code is not used for model training (check their terms). Not self-hostable.                    | Varies, potentially lower than others due to pay-as-you-go |
| Claude (Anthropic)      | API access with usage-based pricing          | Check their API data usage policies. Not designed for direct IDE integration.                      | Highly variable based on usage |
| Google AI Coding Tools | Varies depending on the specific tool and Google Cloud service usage. | Data privacy subject to Google Cloud's general terms.  Not typically self-hostable.                   | Highly variable based on usage, potentially significant with heavy cloud integration |

Armed with this information I would then seek feedback from key stakeholders, including developers, technical leads, and security teams. They will have personal experience, experience from those they know, and opinions that we must factor in.
